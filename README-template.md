## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The biggest learning I gained in this project is the suggestion to treat it as a customer's project. The files provided made it a real process and realistic. So I was forced into making plans on how to proceed. Right up to this time any projects I attempted I just fired up code editor and worked through it. 

Second lesson I learned is about WCAG. I have learned about accessibility but never came across this resource for where to look up standards. Thank you Frontend Mentor.
